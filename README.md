# ReactRails in Reagent

Test project to convert http://www.reactrails.com to [reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/)

Here's the key functionality to support:

## Essentials
* Simple, single table model with no authentication.
* Handling async calls
* Simple validations, server and/or client

## Nice to Have
* Nice to show off some react features
* Deployable to heroku
* Backend of Datomic

Anything else to add to this list?

Please submit PRs!

By the way, if there's an alternative ClojureScript framework that's preferable, let me know and I'll create a separate repo to compare that one.
